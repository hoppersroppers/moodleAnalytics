# Sign Up EMAILS

# Day 1

subjDay1 = "Lesson #1: Welcome to the Show!"

textDay1 = """\
Hey there,

Thank you for signing up to Roppers Academy.

My name is Dennis Devey, and over the next couple of days I'll send you a series of short emails about the site, what matters to me and what I can do to help you fulfill your goals.
The purpose of this series is to give you a roadmap for joining our community and let you know what we have available to help you learn and grow with our community.

You signed up for this site to improve yourself, so we can assume you are here to learn about computers and security, but you've probably got bigger dreams than that. I definitely do.

Why am I so passionate about security?

I talk about it more _here_, but I see security as the enabling force that has allowed the technical advances of the last few decades. Without trust in computers and the underlying systems, nobody would be willing to adopt the technology that has changed humanity for the better. Coupled with the internet, an individual today who wants to make a difference in the world only has to log in to impact thousands of people.

I made this site so I could reach as many people as possible, and create the resources I wish existed when I got started in the field.

As Archimedes once said, 'Give me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and and I will move the world.' The internet is my place to stand, I'm still working on the lever.

Let me know what inspired your interest in the site, or computers and security in general. I am always looking to talk to my students, so if you have any feedback or comments I always want to know. Replying directly to these emails is the best way to reach me.

See you around,
- Dennis Devey

# Day 2

subjDay2 = "Lesson #2: The First Steps"

textDay2 = """\
When I first started learning security, I didn't know where to begin. The number of available resources, topics, and opinions spread around the internet made it basically impossible to choose where to go.

15 years later, there probably are 100x more resources available, and that has made it even more difficult for someone new to the field to know where to start.

I designed these courses with the goal in mind of being the best place on the internet to take your first steps into computing and security. The site has only existed for a few months now, but it looks promising. I am confident there isn't another site with a curriculum as tuned to ensuing the success of new students.

However, taking the first step is not enough. You are registered for the site, but the next steps are the critical ones. You need to build momentum, mentally driving yourself to learn, until learning is a habit.

Many of my students never log back in from the day they enroll in the course. I've been guilty of it with online courses before.

The only way to make any change is to keep showing back up, learning new things each day, and taking those first steps.

Now go learn something,

Dennis

# Day 3

subjDay3 = "Lesson #3: The Next Level"

textDay3 = """\
The ultimate reason you signed up for this site is to give yourself the tools, resources, and support you need to improve your life.

That doesn't necessarily mean that you have a bad life, or that you are unhappy, but instead that you want to improve. That's why the first section is all about _Improving You_.

Whether you are a professional who is looking to brush up on their skills, a complete beginner who got sent this link and was told to sign up, or someone in between, this site has something important to teach you.

That is because the primary thing this course tries to teach is not 'computing' or 'networking' or 'security or any discrete thing like that.

This course is designed to teach you how to learn.

 We've already discussed this yesterday, there are more resources out there to learn more topics than you could ever go through. And the fields of computing and security are far too large for me to try to teach you even 1% of the knowledge that is out there to learn.

These courses are here to teach you how to look at a problem or topic you've never seen before, identify what prior knowledge and resources you have available to you, and then figure out how you are going to handle it. Sometimes that means putting your head in the books and reading documentation for hours. Sometimes that means downloading sample problems and practicing them until you understand the concepts. More often than not, that means Googling for the right resources and asking _the right questions_ to people who have more experience that you do in that topic.

Stick around and when you're done with us, you'll be prepared for whatever comes next.

Go learn something,

Dennis

# Day 7

subjDay4 = "Lesson #4: Lessons from Grace Hopper"
textDay4 = """\
I have always been inspired by Grace Hopper, even before I knew who she was.

If you're new to the field, there's a good chance that you might not have heard of her yet, but you probably have heard this quote which she is given credit for:

"It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."

 Grace Hopper, or if we are being more formal, Rear Admiral Hopper, was a computing pioneer and member of the US Navy who developed the first compiler. If you have never heard of a compiler before (which is to be expected), think of it as a tool which is used to translate human readable code into the instructions that computers execute. A compiler translates, links things together, and tries to arrange everything in the most efficient way possible. Her development of the compiler led to an explosion in the industry as more people than ever before were able to develop code.

The word compiler is derived from the word compilation, which is what I have done here in these courses. I took the best resources I could find, put them in what I thought was the right order. This is my attempt at making this world accessible for everyone, because accessibility should always be the goal.

As you go through this journey, take notes so that you can help the people who will wind up teaching one day.

And for now, go learn something.

Dennis

# Day 5

subjDay5 = "Lesson #5: Why This is Hard"


textDay5 = """\
Sure there is an aspect of technical knowledge and learning what words mean, like compiler, but mostly, this takes time. This is less of a technical challenge and more having the right attitude, willingness to work, and most importantly, the time to do it.

I'll come right out and say it, it never gets easier. Like an iceberg (and as a ship driver, I hate icebergs) there is a lot going on beneath a beginner can only guess at.

A beginner's knowledge gaps can be split up into the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns. The known unknowns are easy to fix. You can name them (what do you want to learn about, do it right now), you can go and do the sections in the course related to them. But eventually you run into a new and exciting challenge. There is infinite complexity in this beautiful world of ours, and the closer you get to the problem, the more of the unknown unknowns you will be able see.

If you talked to the world's leading expert on the most specific topic you can think of, you would find a person with more questions they want to find the answers to than you could possibly think of now as a beginner.

So treasure this period of your journey, where daily you will learn about the existence of a topic, get a grasp of the basics, and realize how many years of work it would take to understand it completely, all in a half hour period.

Nobody knows everything, the only thing that matters is you keep going. The act of learning is what matters, because it is the only thing you can be guaranteed to be doing every day of your career.

You didn't choose this because it sounded easy, right?

Don't stop learning,

Dennis

So if you can't learn everything, or even most of everything, why even bother?

If you'll always be Googling, and asking questions, and reading documentation, why would anyone want to do this?

For a lot of people, it's because as a security professional, you come across some of the hardest and most interesting problems that are out there. There is more information about it in _The Hacker Attitude_, but what it comes down to is that the intersection of hard and interesting results in meaningful work. You will never find yourself doing the same thing, and each day you will find new problems just waiting to be solved.

Before you get to those new and interesting problems noone else has ever solved before, you need to build your skills and master the fundamentals. The only way to learn is to do, and this site will give you a clear path to work through.
